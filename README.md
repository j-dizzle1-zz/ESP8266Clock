# ESP8266Clock
An Esp8266 based clock that will turn on some lights when it is sunrise
I wanted a way to turn on and off lights according to the sunrise and sunset for my aquarium.  I couldn't find any so I decided to build my own.  I will be making it for an esp8266, and one for a particle photon.  Please be patient as it is my first real project.
